I'm an Algerian front-end developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 ibtissem's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself full-stack  development with a dream to build my own website . However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time -  content creation. i start exploring the tech world side by side during my studies where i could learn diffrnt technologies (linux, c, java ... ), and in the sam time i was trying to improve the skills of probleme solving having my dream as goal to achieve ,while discovering this journey i found that design is also one of my things i started learning ui/ix and designing my first ever product ✨TrusPy✨
